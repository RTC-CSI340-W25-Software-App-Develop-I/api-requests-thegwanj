# Express API

## Learning Goals

- [ ] **Understand the request response cycle**
- [ ] **Recall HTTP Requests and VERBS**
- [ ] **Configure an express server**
- [ ] **Configure an express cors**
- [ ] **Create a GET Route that returns data to the front end**
- [ ] **Create a POST route that receives data from request parameters**


## The Request-Response Cycle

Client-server architecture is widely used in modern software development. In this model, a client application, such as a web browser on a phone, sends a request to a backend server. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.   

## HTTP Requests 

## HTTP Verbs

Requests are comprised of a few parts, one if which is it's HTTP Verb which describes the action of the request. 

| HTTP Verb | Description                                  | Example Use Case                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| GET       | Retrieve data from the server                | Fetching a list of restaurants                |
| POST      | Send data to the server to create a resource | Adding a new restaurant to the database       |
| PUT       | Update an existing resource entirely         | Updating the details of an existing restaurant|
| PATCH     | Partially update an existing resource        | Changing a restaurant's hours of operation    |
| DELETE    | Remove a resource from the server            | Deleting a restaurant from the database       |



## Lab Deliverables

1. Configure express 

- Import `restaurants` from `data.js`.
- Invoke `express` and assign it to a variable called `app`.
- Create a variable called `port` and set it to `3000`.
- Call `app.use` and pass it `cors()` to enable cross-origin requests. 
  - CORS is a security feature that typically prevents communication between servers and clients on different domains. Here, weâ€™re allowing this communication.
- Call `app.use` and pass it `express.json()`. This middleware parses incoming JSON requests and converts them into JavaScript objects.
- Leave some blank space for additional code to be added later.
- Call `app.listen`, passing the `port` variable and a callback function.
- In the callback, create a `console.log` that says `Server running on http://localhost:${port}`.

```

import express  from 'express'
import cors from 'cors'
import {restaurants} from './data.js'
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json()); 


//Leave space here for more code 


app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});


```

</details>

2. Create a GET request that will send data to the server. 

- Call `app.get` below `app.use(express.json());`, passing it the string `'/restaurants'` and a callback function with parameters `req` and `res`.
- Inside the callback function, invoke and return `res.json()`, passing the `restaurants` variable as a parameter.
- Run the server using `npm run server`. This script is already set up in `package.json` and will start the server for you.
- We are using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when changes are made. However, if you encounter bugs, you may need to stop the server manually using `cmd + c` (on macOS) or `ctrl + c` (on Windows/Linux).
- Run the live server and check the browser's developer console for the data. 
- **Note**: The src/index.js file contains the code for making requests to the server. When a response is received, it logs the data to the console.

```
//This will go in the space you left in the middle of your code. 

app.get('/restaurants', (req, res) => {
  res.json(restaurants);
});


```

</details>

3. Create a POST request that receives data from the client

- Invoke `app.post`, passing it the path `'/restaurants'` and a callback function with parameters `req` and `res`.
- Inside the callback, create a variable called `newRestaurant` and set it to an object literal. Set the keys of the object to `name`, `address`, `phone`, `cuisine`, `rating`, `hours`, and `menu`. Use the corresponding data from the request body, e.g., `req.body.name`.
- Push `newRestaurant` to the `restaurants` array.
- Invoke `res.status(201)` and chain `.json()`, passing `newRestaurant` as the response.
- Verify your work by checking the result in the browser.

```

app.post('/restaurants', (req, res) => {
  const newRestaurant = {
    id: restaurants.length + 1,
    name: req.body.name,
    address: req.body.address,
    phone: req.body.phone,
    cuisine: req.body.cuisine,
    rating: req.body.rating,
    hours:req.body.hours,
    menu: req.body.menu
  };

  restaurants.push(newRestaurant);
  res.status(201).json(newRestaurant);
});


```

</details>

5. Close down your server by hitting `cmd + c` (on macOS) or `ctrl + c` (on Windows/Linux)
